First and git default branch is call "master".

#start a new git repo
$git init

$git add s1  #stage s1 file
$git commit -m "message"

Git Branchs
-----------
#branch is allowed to work on diffrent version of same file as in parallel. Example: we can have a producation branch and development branch for same project.
$git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph    #shows commit history as a graph
alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"   #setup alias to "graph"


Create new branches
-------------------
$git branch <branch neame>
$git branch SDN   # creating brach called SDN

Checkout and work on branches.
------------------------------
$git checkout SDN   #switching to SDN branch

Merging branch
-------------
got to master branch and run below command.

$git merge SDN  #we need to run this command after switching to master branch. Befor that we need to update staging file and commit all the changes made in SDN branch.
git branch --merged  #will confirm the merging.

Delete Branch
-------------
$git branch -d SDN  # deleting SDN (Run this from Master branch. Before removing this SDN branch merge the same to master branch.)
$git brach -D SDN  #this will forcefully delete the branch witout any warning. If the brach is not merged wit master, we will lose our data.

Merage Conflicts
----------------
merage conflicts happen when we try to merge branches that has change the same line in the same file.
$git checkout -b dev  #this commands creates the dev brach and checkout the same. 
$git dev merge dev


Detached HEAD state
--------------------
#usually HEAD points to a branch which turn points to a commit. When HEAD is instead pointing directly to a commit, we have a detached HEAD state.
$git checkout <5 commit hash value>   # In this case the head will detach from the branch and point to exact commit.
$git checkout <branch name>   # now we point the HEAD to <brach name>

Git stash
----------
#With git stash "Git has saved our new changes to the file, so we can apply them back later".
$git stash    #save all the changes on the files, so we can later add that to staging area.
$it stash list  #display all the stash we made.
$git stash list -p  #we can observe the edits that occured with each stash point.
$git stash apply  #re-apply the most recent stash. after that we need to perform "git add ." then commit.
$git stash apply <label> # Re-apply the label stash.
$git stash save "messahe" #we can stash with a message
